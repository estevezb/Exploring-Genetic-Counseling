The purpose of this site is to organize my exploration of the field of Genetic Counseling from the perspectice of a student interested in a career in the field. As my understanding of the field grows, I envision revisiting some earlier posts and diving even deeper into those specific topics. My hope is that others find this information useful in their own studies and that it sparks a general interest in the field.
