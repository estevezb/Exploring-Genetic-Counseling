The purpose of this site is to organize my exploration of the field of Genetic Counseling from the perspectice of a student interested in a career in the field. As my understanding grows so to will the scope and depth of the topics I discuss here. My hope is that others find this information useful in their own studies and that it sparks a general interest in the field.
