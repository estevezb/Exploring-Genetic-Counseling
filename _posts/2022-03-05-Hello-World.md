DNA is a chemical code that impacts many aspects of our health. Variations in that DNA code -or smaller parts of it called genes- are passed down from generation to generation, and some of those changes can cause familial diseases or birth defects.  Genetics is the study of DNA, its constituent genes and their inheritance.  

The field of genetic counseling can be thought of as a branch of human genetics. Consequently, genetic counselors are well-versed in human genetics. Perhaps more importantly, genetic counselors (GCs) help patients and their families navigate the impact of genetic abnormalities on their health. GCs play an important in healthcare. A key aspect of their job is educating patients on genetic testing. Like a specialty physician, such as a Hematologist, genetic counselors will have an area of specialization. These specialties are prenatal, neurology, ophthalmology, pediatric, psychiatry, oncology, and metabolic disorders <sup>[1]</sup>. 

As mentioned GCs are trained in medical genetics and in counseling patients that want information about how inherited conditions may impact them or their relatives. GCs are also trained in how to interpret a patientâ€™s genetic results in the context of their family history. Because they are also trained counselors, GCs also provide emotional support that helps patients making tough decisions and serve as source of information that can assist patients navigating their healthcare.

A patient may be referred to a GC by their physician to discuss family history and genetic risks. The referral to the GC can be before or after genetic testing is performed. GCs will educate patients on their genetic risk for certain diseases and potential for birth defects, when to seek out genetic testing and what the results mean for the patient and their family. As the names implies, genetic testing is a test that looks for disease-causing changes in genes or DNA.  Blood, cheek swabs or saliva can be used to extract patient DNA that is needed for genetic tests <sup>[2]</sup>. 

GCs can have other jobs outside of educating and interacting with patients, including research, academia, industry, marketing. GCs can work in university settings, private and public hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and in physician offices <sup>[3]</sup>.
