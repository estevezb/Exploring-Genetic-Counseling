The purpose of this site is to document and organize my exploration of the field of Genetic Counseling from the perspective of a student interested in a career in the field. As my understanding of the field grows, I envision revisiting specific topics from earlier posts and diving deeper. My long-term hope for this site is that it serves as a key way station for all newcomers with interest in the field.
